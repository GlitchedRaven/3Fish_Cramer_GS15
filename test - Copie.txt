Il faut quand même pas écraser tous les délires. Celui qui délire peut certes le réduire à l'impuissance mais la la puissance du délire c'est quoi0 ?

We have seen in the preceding chapters that anthropology is the study of man through
the assumption of culture, a notion that includes the thoughts and actions of both the
anthropologist and his subjects as varieties of the same phenomenon. In its broadest and
simplest connotation, "culture" provides a relativistic basis for the understanding of other
peoples. We study culture through culture, and so whatever operations characterize our
investigation must also be general properties of culture. If invention is indeed the most crucial
aspect of our understanding of other cultures, then this must be of central significance in
the way in which all cultures operate. If, in other words, we admit to the anthropologist's
creativity in building his comprehension of a culture, we can scarcely deny the same sort of
creativity to the culture itself and its members.
Invention, then, is culture, and it might be helpful to think of all human beings,
wherever they may be, as "fieldworkers" of a sort, controlling the culture shock of daily
experience through all kinds of imagined and constructed "rules," traditions, and facts. The
anthropologist makes his experiences understandable (to himself as well as to others in his
society) by perceiving them and understanding them in terms of his own familiar way of life,
his Culture. He invents them as "culture." And because he has learned all his life to
communicate with others, his friends and family as well as his colleagues, through the
shared conventions of this Culture, he is now able to communicate with members of a
different society through the "culture" he has invented for them. Because his subject culture
has become meaningful to him in the way that his own life is meaningful, he is able to communicate
his experiences of it to those who share the meanings and conventions of his own
way of life.
If we assume that every human being is an "anthropologist," an inventor of culture, then it
follows that all people need a set of shared conventions similar in some way to our collective
"Culture" in order to communicate and understand their experiences. And if invention is truly
as basic to human existence as I have suggested, then communication and the set of shared
conventions and associations that allow communication to take place are equally basic. All
meaningful expression, and therefore all experience and understanding, is a kind of
invention, and invention requires a communicational base in shared conventions if it is to be
meaningful — that is if it is to allow us to relate what we do, say, and feel to others, and to
the world of meanings that we share with them. Expression and communication are
interdependent: neither is possible without the other.
Our discussion of cargo cult and of production in tribal society has shown how
inadequate the Western Culture of collective enterprise is as a model for the self-invention of
tribal peoples. If the communicational basis of Yali's invention is so different from our own,
an understanding of culture as invention requires that we consider the whole matter of
communication and inventive expression in some detail. What do we mean by the
"conventional associations" of a word or some other symbolic element, how do they
objectify "reality"; and what is the relation of their "conventionalness" to the kind of extension
that I have equated with invention? How, in other words, is invention related to man's larger
conception of himself and the world? I will try to answer this question generally at first,
